# iOS Passbook Tutorial

Ole Begemann, February 2013.

A sample web server, written in Ruby, and an iOS app that I discuss in a [detailed tutorial on my blog](http://localhost:3000/blog/2013/02/passbook-tutorial/). Please refer to the blog post for more information.

As far as it was written by myself, the code is licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Apple Sample Code

The server implementation is based on Apple's own reference server implementation for Passbook and therefore contains extensive amounts of Apple sample code that Apple provides under the following license:

## ZBar SDK

The iOS app includes the [ZBar SDK](http://zbar.sourceforge.net/iphone/sdkdoc/) for barcode scanning. ZBar is licensed under the LGPL. See ZBar's own [Licensing the Library page](http://zbar.sourceforge.net/iphone/sdkdoc/licensing.html) for details.
